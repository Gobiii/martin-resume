<h1>ABOUT ME:</h1>
<p>I am on my way to becoming a Full Stack Developer. I love learning new stuff and I love that I can build something from scratch. I've been programming for a little over 8 years but it's been on and off. That is why I am starting my learning again from scratch to rebuild my knowledge of programming. I love working with other people and I also love independence. If you wish to get to know me better feel free to contact me, you will find all the necessary information on Contact page.</p>
